# Quiz

I am attempting to create a U.S. History/Constitution Quiz. The design is supposed to have an American theme and my plan was to include a picture with each question.
I didn't get very far and am clearly missing a lot of components. I watched several videos on youtube and googled numerous example quizzes but simply got lost with all the information. I didn't want to simply copy from the you tube videos but did want to build my quiz with my own code.
I pretty much only got one question on the page, I did go through a couple designs and at one point had multiple html pages like the you tube videos but decided that was too confusing (unless of course I simply copied everything).
I got one question (with TA help) to appear. I have notes about what I am supposed to do next but clearly did not get them to work.
